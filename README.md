# Building and Installing CORD

This is the main entry point for building and installing CORD.

If this is your first encounter with CORD, we suggest you start by
bringing up an emulated version called CORD-in-a-Box.
It installs CORD on a set of virtual machines running on a single
physical server. Just follow our [CORD-in-a-Box Guide](docs/quickstart.md).

You can also install CORD on a physical POD. This involves first assembling
a set of servers and switches, and then pointing the build system at
that target hardware. Just follow our
[Physical POD Guide](docs/quickstart_physical.md).
