# Building and Installing CORD

This guide describes how to build and install CORD.

If this is your first encounter with CORD, we suggest you start by
bringing up an emulated version called _CORD-in-a-Box_.
It installs CORD on a set of virtual machines running on a single
physical server. Just follow our [CORD-in-a-Box Guide](quickstart.md).

You can also install CORD on a physical POD. This involves first assembling
a set of servers and switches, and then pointing the build system at
that target hardware. You can either follow our
[Quick Start Guide](quickstart_physical.md), or read a more detailed,
step-by-step recipe for [Installing a Physical POD](install_pod.md).
