# Guide Overview

This GitBook is a curated set of guides that describe how to install, operate, test, and develop CORD.

Source for individual guides is available in the CORD code repository (https://gerrit.opencord.org); look in the `/docs` directory of each project, with the GitBook rooted in `cord/docs`. Updates and improvements to this documentation can be submitted through Gerrit.

CORD is a community-based open source project. In addition to this guide,
you can find information about this community, its projects, and its governance
on the [CORD wiki](https://wiki.opencord.org). This includes early white papers
and design notes that have shaped [CORD's architecture](https://wiki.opencord.org/display/CORD/Documentation).
