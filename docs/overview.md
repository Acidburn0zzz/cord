# Guide Overview

This GitBook is a curated set of guides that describe how to install, operate, test, and develop CORD.

Source for individual guides is available in the CORD code repository (https://gerrit.opencord.org); look in the `/docs` directory of each project, with the GitBook rooted in `cord/docs`. Updates and improvements to this documentation can be submitted through Gerrit.

The community is in the process of migrating documents to these guides. You can find additional information on the [CORD wiki](https://wiki.opencord.org), and in particular, a set of _CORD Design Notes_ on the [Documentation](https://wiki.opencord.org/display/CORD/Documentation) page.
